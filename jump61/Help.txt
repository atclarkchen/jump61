Commands may be in any mixture of case. You may abbreviate commands
but not moves with any unique prefix (e.g., 'c' for clear).
Commands:
    <row> <column> Put piece on given row and column. (row 1 is topmost, column 1 is leftmost)

    start           Start a new game or restart a suspended one.
    new             Short for clear followed by start.
    auto <P>        Stops the current game until the next start command and causes player P to be
                    played by an automated player (an AI) on subsequent moves. The value P must be “red”
                    or “blue” (ignore case—“Red” or “RED” also work). Initially, Blue is an automated
                    player.
    manual<P>       Stops the current game until the next start command and causes player P to
                    take moves from the terminal on subsequent moves. The value of P is as for the auto
                    command. Initially, Red is a manual player.
    size<N>         Stops any current game, clears the board to its initial configuration, and sets the
                    size of the board to N squares, where 2 ≤ N ≤ 10. Initially, N = 6.

    set <R> <C> <N> <P>
        Stop any current game. Put N spots at row R and column C (see §3.1). P
        is either ‘b’ or ‘r’ (for blue or red,) indicating the color of the square. When N is 0, P
        is ignored and the square is cleared. N must be non-negative and less than or equal to
        the number of neighboring squares.

    clear   Abandons the current game if there is one in progress and clears the board to its initial
            configuration (all squares neutral with one spot). Playing stops until next START command.

    dump            Prints board state in standard format.
    seed<N>         Seed the pseudo-random number generator used by automated players to <N>.
                    Identical seeds cause identical sequences of responses to the same inputs.

    verbose     Display the board after each move.
    quiet       Don't display the board after each move.

    quit        Exit the program.
    help        Print this message.
